<tr>
    <td> [Bill Search](#methods/bill-search) </td>
    <td> /bills/ </td>
    <td> Search bills by (almost) any of their attributes, or full text.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> [Bill Detail](#methods/bill-detail) </td>
    <td> /bills/`state`/`session`/`bill_id`/ </td>
    <td> Get full detail for bill, including any actions, votes, etc. </td>
</tr>
</table>

Methods
-------

### Bill Search

This method returns just a subset (``state``, ``chamber``, ``session``, ``subjects``, ``type``, ``id``, ``bill_id``, ``title``, ``created_at``, ``updated_at``) of the bill fields by default.

#### Filter Parameters

The following parameters filter the returned set of bills, at least one must be provided.

* ``state``         Only return bills from a given state (e.g. 'nc')
* ``chamber``       Only return bills matching the provided chamber ('upper' or 'lower')
* ``bill_id``       Only return bills with a given bill_id.
* ``bill_id__in``   Accepts a pipe (|) delimited list of bill ids.
* ``q``             Only return bills matching the provided full text query.
* ``search_window`` By default all bills are searched, but if a time window is desired the following options can be passed to search_window:
    * ``search_window=all``     Default, include all sessions.
    * ``search_window=term``    Only bills from sessions within the current term.
    * ``search_window=session`` Only bills from the current session.
    * ``search_window=session:2009`` Only bills from the session named 2009.
    * ``search_window=term:2009-2011`` Only bills from the sessions in the 2009-2011 session.
* ``updated_since`` Only bills updated since a provided date (provided in YYYY-MM-DD format)
* ``sponsor_id``    Only bills sponsored by a given legislator id (e.g. 'ILL000555')
* ``subject``       Only bills categorized by Open States as belonging to this subject.
* ``type``          Only bills of a given type (e.g. 'bill', 'resolution', etc.)

#### Additional Parameters

``sort``      Sort-order of results, defaults to 'last', options are:

* 'first'
* 'last'
* 'signed'
* 'passed_lower'
* 'passed_upper'
* 'updated_at'
* 'created_at'

See the above ``action_dates``, ``created_at``, and ``updated_at`` documentation for the meaning of these dates.

The API will not return exceedingly large responses, so it may be necessary to use ``page`` and ``per_page`` to control the number of results returned:

* ``page``      Page of results, each of size ``per_page`` (defaults to 1)
* ``per_page``  Number of results per page, is unlimited unless page is set, in which case it defaults to 50.

**Example:** [openstates.org/api/v1/bills/?state=dc&q=taxi](#examples/bill-search)

### Bill Detail

This method returns the full detail object for a bill.

**Example:** [openstates.org/api/v1/bills/ca/20092010/AB%20667/](#examples/bill-detail)

**Note:** This method has an alternate URL form:

* ``bills/openstates_bill_id`` - e.g. ``openstates.org/api/v1/bills/CAB00004148/`` - allows lookup by bill_id
